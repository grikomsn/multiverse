## Introduction üëã

Sometime around 2018, I was working on a web app using [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) on an older version. At the time, one of the features of Next.js is that it supports initial data population using the [`getInitialProps` static method](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/getInitialProps), which means that you can populate the page component `props` before loading the page (e.g. fetching news feeds).

The latest docs for Next.js is available on their [official website](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). At [version 9.1.7](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v9.1.7) and before, the docs was published on GitHub. Specifically at the ["Fetching data and component lifecycle"](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v9.1.7#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle) section, it shows how to use `getInitialProps` and what parameters that can be destructured. A snippet from their readme:

<Reference>

`getInitialProps` receives a context object with the following properties:

- `pathname` - path section of URL
- `query` - query string section of URL parsed as an object
- `asPath` - `String` of the actual path (including the query) shows in the browser
- `req` - HTTP request object (server only)
- `res` - HTTP response object (server only)
- `err` - Error object if any error is encountered during the rendering

</Reference>

Before updating this post, `getInitialProps` has one additional property which you can read on their readme at [version 8.0.0 and below](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v8.0.0#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle):

<Reference>

`jsonPageRes` - [Fetch Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object (client only)

</Reference>

Pretty straightforward, right? Except for one minor problem.

## Something‚Äôs not right üî•

On another part of the readme which explains on [how to use a custom `App` component on `_app.js`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v9.0.0#custom-app), it also uses `getInitialProps` but with different destructured context parameters. Here's the code snippet from the readme:

```js {1}
static async getInitialProps({ Component, router, ctx }) {
  let pageProps = {}

  if (Component.getInitialProps) {
    pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx)
  }

  return { pageProps }
}
```

From the snippet above, it shows that `getInitialProps` doesn't use the documented object properties. And also it seems that I'm not the only one confused about this. Quoting from a [discussion on a Spectrum thread](https://spectrum.chat/?t=07e9ab0e-0fae-43a8-8bc0-350c79e921a3),

> _What damn are_ and _where are coming from_ the following properties of the context parameter?

So for many weeks, I searched the codebase, issues, and even Spectrum threads related to `getInitialProps`. And in this post I will try my best to explain the `getInitialProps` debacle.

## Inspecting and dumping ‚ú®

In [another Spectrum thread that I created](https://spectrum.chat/?t=bd0da841-05f0-4b3b-8f1f-9e6b16b1952b), [@revskill](https://spectrum.chat/users/revskill) recommends using `util.inspect` to analyze objects. So I made a temporary page (`pages/temp.js`) and use this snippet below to dump the `getInitialProps` parameter using `util.inspect` (note that this is Next.js before version 9):

```js {7,12}
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { inspect } from "util";

export default class extends Component {
  static getInitialProps(something) {
    return {
      pageLog: inspect(something, true, 0),
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.pageLog);
  }

  render() {
    return <pre>Check the console ^^</pre>;
  }
}
```

Checking the console, it returns this:

```js
{ err: undefined,
  req: [Object],
  res: [Object],
  pathname: '/',
  query: {},
  asPath: '/' }
```

All properties shown are already documented on the readme, so where's `Component`, `router`, and `ctx`? Because the readme shows that those three properties are used on a custom `App`, so I made `pages/_app.js` and dump the parameter on `getInitialProps` like before (again, note that this is before version 9):

```js {16,21}
import App, { Container } from "next/app";
import React from "react";
import { inspect } from "util";

export default class MyApp extends App {
  static async getInitialProps(something) {
    const { Component, ctx } = something;
    let pageProps = {};

    if (Component.getInitialProps) {
      pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx);
    }

    return {
      pageProps,
      appLog: inspect(something, true, 0),
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.appLog);
  }

  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props;

    return (
      <Container>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```

Now the console returns two logs:

```js
{ err: undefined,
  req: [Object],
  res: [Object],
  pathname: '/',
  query: {},
  asPath: '/' }

{ Component: [Object], router: [Object], ctx: [Object] }
```

As you can see on the snippet above, I destructured two properties: `Component` and `ctx`. So from my understanding is that the `Component` object is the page component that will be loaded (e.g. `pages/index.js`), and the `ctx` object is the `App` context (which explains why it has a `router` property). Note the `if (Component.getInitialProps)`, it's quite obvious that what it does is checks whether the page component has a getInitialProps function to run.

So what that means is the `getInitialProps` parameter (or context) differs from a page component. But this doesn't explain another thing.

## Type? What type? üê¥

I‚Äôm a sucker for object types, so it really bothers me when statically adding `getInitialProps` to an `App` or page component obviously doesn't give any hints on my editor. And after inspecting a lot above, at some point I asked myself, "does `next` has a `@types` package?" [And they have!](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/5b30992fd59e4a145b7589f2b333673f231fd36f/types/next/index.d.ts) Why did I bother inspecting ony by one?

**March 2020 update note**: [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped) has deprecated the Next.js typings since version 9 already includes its own TypeScript declaration file. You can [view the deprecation pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/40235), courtesy of [Resi Respati](https://resir014.xyz).

After that sudden realization, I added the type package and checked whether it has an object or interface with the name 'context using the IntelliSense extensions on Visual Studio Code. Lo and behold, I found three interfaces 'context' related (remember that this is before version 9):

```js
import { NextContext } from "next";
import { AppComponentContext, NextAppContext } from "next/app";
```

After finding those three, I tried type hinting the `getInitialProps` function on both `_app.js` and a page component, and the results was fantastic:

![App context object properties](/images/app-context-object-properties.png)

![Page context object properties](/images/page-context-object-properties.png)

Much better! Now I have found out that it has a `@types` package, getting to know more about its type and contents is much easier.

## Getting to know more üöÄ

In Visual Studio Code, you can jump to the definition of the type by command or control clicking the variable like below:

![Preview on control or command clicking the object type](/images/control-click.gif)

From the GIF above, it opens the declaration files in the `node_modules` directory in `node_modules/@types/next`. Or you can view the file on the [`@types/next` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/5b30992fd59e4a145b7589f2b333673f231fd36f/types/next/index.d.ts). Here's a snippet from the declaration files for the context object on the `App` component (`NextAppContext`):

```js
/**
 * Context passed to App.getInitialProps.
 * Component is dynamic - cannot infer type.
 *
 * @template Q Query object schema.
 */
export interface NextAppContext<Q extends DefaultQuery = DefaultQuery> {
    Component: NextComponentType<any, any, NextContext<Q>>;
    router: RouterProps<Q>;
    ctx: NextContext<Q>;
}
```

And here‚Äôs the context declaration for page components (`NextContext`):

```js
/**
 * Context object used in methods like `getInitialProps()`
 * https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/7.0.0/server/render.js#L97
 * https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/7.0.0/README.md#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle
 *
 * @template Q Query object schema.
 */
interface NextContext<Q extends DefaultQuery = DefaultQuery> {
    /** path section of URL */
    pathname: string;
    /** query string section of URL parsed as an object */
    query: Q;
    /** String of the actual path (including the query) shows in the browser */
    asPath: string;
    /** HTTP request object (server only) */
    req?: http.IncomingMessage;
    /** HTTP response object (server only) */
    res?: http.ServerResponse;
    /** Fetch Response object (client only) - from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response */
    jsonPageRes?: NodeResponse;
    /** Error object if any error is encountered during the rendering */
    err?: Error;
}
```

That‚Äôs much better than inspecting objects one by one. üòÖ

Hopefully this adventure log isn't that confusing, since `getInitialProps` is already confusing at the start. Thanks for reading, and happy coding! üëãüèª
